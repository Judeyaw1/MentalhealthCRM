# Mental Health Tracker - Deployment Progress & Fixes

## Project Overview
Mental Health Tracker is a full-stack application with React frontend and Node.js/Express backend, deployed on Railway.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Local Development Issues
- **Problem**: White/blank page on local development
- **Root Cause**: No development server running
- **Fix**: Started development server with `npm run dev`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 2. MongoDB Connection Issues
- **Problem**: `‚ùå MongoDB connection error: Error: querySrv ENOTFOUND _mongodb._tcp.cluster.mongodb.net`
- **Root Cause**: Conflicting `MONGODB_URI` entries in `.env` (local vs. Atlas with placeholder credentials)
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed invalid Atlas URI from `.env`
  - Set `NODE_ENV=development` to use local MongoDB
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 3. Vite Integration Issues
- **Problem**: `TypeError: setupVite is not a function`
- **Root Cause**: `setupVite` function called before asynchronous import completed
- **Fix**: Restructured `server/index.ts` to `await import("./vite")` before calling `viteModule.setupVite`
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 4. Railway Production Deployment Issues
- **Problem**: White/blank page on Railway production deployment
- **Root Cause**: Catch-all route in `server/routes.ts` blocking static assets
- **Fix**: 
  - Removed conflicting catch-all route from `server/routes.ts`
  - Implemented robust static file serving and SPA catch-all logic in `server/index.ts`
  - Ensured static files served BEFORE SPA fallback
- **Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED

### 5. Logo Display Issues on Railway
- **Problem**: Logo displaying as question mark or "NL" text instead of actual logo
- **Root Cause**: Multiple issues with static asset serving and file deployment
- **Fix Attempts**:
  1. **Attempt 1**: Refined catch-all route to exclude static assets - ‚ùå Still returning HTML
  2. **Attempt 2**: `Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, stat '/app/dist/public/logo.png'` - ‚ùå `dist/` directory excluded by `.railwayignore`
  3. **Attempt 3**: Fixed `Dynamic require of "fs" is not supported` and `await` outside `async` function - ‚ùå Logo still not found
  4. **Attempt 4**: Moved logo to root `public/` directory - ‚ùå Still not found
  5. **Attempt 5**: Reverted to original approach - ‚ùå Still not found
  6. **Attempt 6**: Made catch-all route more specific - ‚ùå Still not found
  7. **Attempt 7**: Moved static middleware registration - ‚ùå Still not found
  8. **Attempt 8**: Copied logo to project root and updated custom route - üîÑ IN PROGRESS

### 6. Email Service Connection Timeout Issues on Railway
- **Problem**: `Failed to send email: Error: Connection timeout` with SMTP connection failures
- **Root Cause**: Railway network restrictions and Gmail SMTP connection timeouts
- **Fix**: 
  - Enhanced SMTP configuration with longer timeouts (60s connection, 30s greeting, 60s socket)
  - Added connection pooling and rate limiting
  - Implemented retry logic with 3 attempts and progressive backoff
  - Added alternative SMTP transporter with port 587 (STARTTLS) as fallback
  - Added connection verification and better error logging
- **Status**: ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED - Ready for testing

## Current Status
- **Local Development**: ‚úÖ Working correctly
- **Railway Deployment**: ‚úÖ Application loads, but logo still not displaying
- **Logo Issue**: üîÑ Latest fix in progress - logo copied to root directory with custom route
- **Email Service**: ‚úÖ Enhanced with retry logic and alternative configurations - ready for testing

## Files Modified

### Frontend Files (Logo Path Updates)
- `client/index.html` - Updated favicon and apple-touch-icon paths
- `client/src/pages/Landing.tsx` - Updated logo paths in landing page
- `client/src/pages/Login.tsx` - Updated logo path in login page
- `client/src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx` - Updated logo path in login form
- `client/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Updated logo path in header

### Backend Files (Server Configuration)
- `server/index.ts` - Fixed Vite integration, improved static file serving, added SPA catch-all route
- `server/routes.ts` - Removed conflicting routes, added custom logo route with multiple path checking
- `server/emailService.ts` - Enhanced SMTP configuration with retry logic, timeouts, and alternative transporter
- `.env` - Cleaned up conflicting MongoDB URIs
- `.railwayignore` - Removed `dist/` exclusion to ensure built files are deployed

### Build & Deployment
- `package.json` - No changes, but build scripts working correctly
- `railway.json` - Railway configuration working
- `scripts/deploy-railway.sh` - Made executable for deployment

## Technical Details

### Build Process
```bash
npm run build  # vite build && esbuild server/index.ts
npm start      # cross-env NODE_ENV=production node dist/index.js
```

### Static File Serving Strategy
1. **Development**: Vite dev server handles static files
2. **Production**: Express serves from `dist/public` directory
3. **Logo**: Custom route with multiple path fallbacks for Railway deployment

### Railway Deployment
- **Command**: `railway up`
- **Process**: Automatic build and deployment
- **Builder**: Nixpacks
- **Static Files**: Served from `dist/public` directory

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy Latest Changes**: Run `railway up` to apply logo fix
2. **Test Logo Display**: Verify logo loads correctly on Railway
3. **Monitor Logs**: Check Railway logs for any remaining issues
4. **Final Testing**: Ensure all functionality works in production

## Lessons Learned
1. **Static Asset Serving**: Critical to serve static files before SPA catch-all routes
2. **Railway Deployment**: `.railwayignore` can significantly impact file availability
3. **Path Resolution**: Railway container paths may differ from local development
4. **Build Process**: Vite build output must be preserved for production deployment
5. **Error Handling**: Custom routes with multiple fallback paths improve reliability

## Environment Configuration
- **Local**: `NODE_ENV=development`, Local MongoDB
- **Production**: `NODE_ENV=production`, Railway environment variables
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (production), Local MongoDB (development)

## Commands Used
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Production Start
npm start

# Railway Deployment
railway up

# Check Railway Logs
railway logs
```
